HDR NASA-SSH ENSO Sea Surface Height Anomaly Indicator
HDR 
HDR This file contains an indicator for the El Nino-Southern Oscillation
HDR (ENSO), based on satellite observations of sea surface height anomaly,  
HDR measured by radar altimeter missions such as TOPEX/Poseidon, the Jason 
HDR series, and Sentinel-6. The indicator values were calculated using 
HDR NASA-SSH Simple Gridded Sea Surface Height from Standardized Reference 
HDR Missions Only Version 1 
HDR https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/NASA_SSH_REF_SIMPLE_GRID_V1 . 
HDR 
HDR Indicator values were calculated using cyclostationary empirical  
HDR orthogonal functions (CSEOFs; Kim et al., 2015) computed by decomposing  
HDR the gridded sea surface height anomalies over the time period from 1993 to 
HDR 2019. After removing the linear trend from each individual gridded 
HDR location, three sets of regional CSEOFs were generated, one each for ENSO, 
HDR the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Indian Ocean Diode (IOD). In 
HDR each case, the dominant statistical mode represents the seasonal cycle. 
HDR The second most dominant mode represents the variability explained by each 
HDR respective indicator and is referred to as the “indicator mode”. The 
HDR seasonal mode and indicator mode are then projected onto the along-track 
HDR sea surface height anomalies to produce the indicator time series through 
HDR the most current date.  In this case, the ENSO mode was used to produce 
HDR the time series contained in this file.

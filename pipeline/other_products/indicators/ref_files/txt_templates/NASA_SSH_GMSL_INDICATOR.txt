HDR NASA-SSH Global Mean Sea Level from Simple Gridded Sea Surface Height 
HDR 
HDR This file contains a time series of globally-averaged sea level change, or 
HDR "global mean sea level" (GMSL) in units of centimeters.  The estimate is 
HDR based on satellite observations of sea surface height anomaly, measured by 
HDR reference radar altimeter missions such as TOPEX/Poseidon, the Jason 
HDR series, and Sentinel-6. The indicator values were calculated using NASA-SSH 
HDR Simple Gridded Sea Surface Height from Standardized Reference Missions Only 
HDR Version 1 https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/NASA_SSH_REF_SIMPLE_GRID_V1 . 
HDR 
HDR GMSL was calculated as the area-weighted average over each map in the time 
HDR series of Simple Gridded Sea Surface Height.  Because maps are computed  
HDR using 10-days of observations, but are computed once every 7 days, there is 
HDR a small amount of overlap between data used to compute successive time 
HDR steps. A version of the estimate smoothed over 60 days is also provided.
HDR The estimates have been shifted to have zero mean over calendar year 1993.
HDR 
HDR Expert users, please note that this estimate has NOT been adjusted for 
HDR Glacial Isostatic Adjustment, to account for the slight long-term  
HDR depression of the sea floor.  Users who study the sea level budget will 
HDR need to account for this effect in order to properly evaluate closure of 
HDR the budget.

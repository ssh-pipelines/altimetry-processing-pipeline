HDR NASA-SSH PDO Sea Surface Height Indicator
HDR 
HDR This file contains an indicator for the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), 
HDR based on satellite observations of sea surface height anomaly, measured by 
HDR radar altimeter missions such as TOPEX/Poseidon, the Jason series, and 
HDR Sentinel-6. The indicator values were calculated using NASA-SSH Simple  
HDR Gridded Sea Surface Height from Standardized Reference Missions Only 
HDR Version 1 https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/NASA_SSH_REF_SIMPLE_GRID_V1 . 
HDR 
HDR Indicator values were calculated using cyclostationary empirical orthogonal 
HDR functions (CSEOFs; Kim et al., 2015) computed by decomposing the gridded 
HDR sea surface height anomalies over the time period from 1993 to 2019. After 
HDR removing the linear trend from each individual gridded location, three sets 
HDR of regional CSEOFs were generated, one each for El Nino-Southern  
HDR Oscillation (ENSO), the PDO and Indian Ocean Diode (IOD). In each case, the 
HDR dominant statistical mode represents the seasonal cycle. The second most 
HDR dominant mode represents the variability explained by each respective 
HDR indicator and is referred to as the “indicator mode”. The seasonal mode and 
HDR indicator mode are then projected onto the along-track sea surface height 
HDR anomalies to produce the indicator time series through the most current 
HDR date.  In this case, the PDO mode was used to produce the time series 
HDR contained in this file.
